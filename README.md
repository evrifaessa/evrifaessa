Hey 👋🏻. My name is Yağızhan ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): [/jɑːɫızhɑn/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=j%C9%91%CB%90%C9%AB%C4%B1zh%C9%91n&voice=Filiz)), I'm a 18-year-old student from Istanbul, Turkey. I like spending time engaging with open-source projects and communities.

While I first started doing open-source stuff to procrastinate from school, I soon realized the impact OSS has on me, other people, companies and even some parts of society as a whole. That's when I decided to dedicate more time to taking part and contributing.

If you're looking for a project to contribute to, check out [FOSSBilling](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling).

⭐ I also am looking for some side projects to contribute to, If you have any suggestions, drop me an email at [hi@yagiz.dev](mailto:hi@yagiz.dev) or add me on Discord: `@evrifaessa99`.
